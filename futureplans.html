            <h3>Long Term Plans</h3>
            <p>Currently my long term plans rotate around my wife and future
                family. I am planning on buying a home for my wife and I so 
                that we can start a family in the next few years. I am also 
                planning to further my education in computer sciences in either
                Web Development or Software Engineering. All of these things are
                going to help us (my wife and I) better our quality of life.
            </p>
            <h3>Short Term Plans</h3>
            <p>In the nearer future, I plan on finishing my Certification in Web Developement
                through Neumont College of Computer Sciences. On completion of my
                certification I am planning on getting a good job and furthering my skills, 
                and knowledge of web developement. Through hard work and determination I will use
                these short term plans as a stepping stool to achieve my long term plans.
