            <h2>Long Term Plans</h2>
            <p>Currently my long term plans rotate around my wife and future
                family. I am planning on buying a home for my wife and I so 
                that we can start a family in the next few years. I am also 
                planning to further my education in computer sciences in either
                Web Development or Software Engineering. All of these things are
                going to help us <em>(my wife and I)</em>better our quality of life.
            </p>
            <h2>Short Term Plans</h2>
            <p>In the nearer future, I plan on finishing my Certification in Web Developement
                through <em>Neumont College of Computer Sciences</em>. On completion of my
                certification I am planning on getting a good job and furthering my skills, 
                and knowledge of web developement. Through hard work and determination I will use
                these short term plans as a stepping stool to achieve my long term plans.
