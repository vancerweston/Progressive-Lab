            <p>Some of my intersts include: basketball, football, 
                Olypmics, wood working, web development, vidoe games
                and many more. Although I love to spend hours in each 
                of these things, the thing I love to do the most is spend
                time with my beautiful wife, Crystal.

            <p>To get a little more in detail I'll cover some specifics about
                my hobbies. My favorite basketball team is the Utah Jazz, and
                for football is the Seattle Seahawks. I am really enjoying learning
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript and much more though Web Development and Neumont. 
                I enjoy just about any video game as long as I have <q>friend</q> to play it with.
                As far as wood working goes, I am very new to this, but I have found
                that I enjoy making small crafted trinkets and decortive items.
