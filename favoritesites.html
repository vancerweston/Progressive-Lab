                <li>Neumont Canvas <!--https://lms.neumont.edu --></li>
                <li>CodeAcadamy <!--https://www.codeacadamy.com --></li>

            <p>Currently I don't spend a lot of down time on the web. 
                Most of my time is spent learning and practicing Web Development. Currently
                these are my favorite sites because of my excitment to learn and improve
                upon my coding skills. I look forward to becoming more proficent in 
                HTML, CSS, JavaScrip, and many other coding languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I do have other interest that attract my attention. For example 
                espn is a place that I try to catch up on the teams I am interested in. 
                This being said, that doesn't happen very often which is why it is listed
                where it is in my favorite sites.
