        <section class="main-info">      
            <p>Growing up in <em>Laketown, Utah</em>, I never really had much of an experience
                with <q>big towns</q>, computers, shopping malls, or freeways. Any little
                bit of research would show you that Laketown, sitting on the sourthern
                shore of Bear Lake, has a population of <strong>250-300</strong> people depending on the
                year. With this kind of demographic population I grew up on a cattle 
                ranch.
            </p>
            <p>Wrestling cattle, branding, riding horses, and driving tractors were my 
                skills as a boy. As these things may not translate into a powerful
                career in the world today, they have helped sculpt me into a successful employee,
                student, and person. I learned hard work and diligence, which helped me in 
                the many fields I have been in, but currently they help me as I have been studying
                and applying Web Development.
